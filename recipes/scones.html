        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li> 
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter, frozen</li>
            <li>½ cup raisins (or dried currants)</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                
                
        </ol>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Grate butter into flour mixture on the large holes of a box grater. Use your fingers to work in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, then toss in raisins.</li>
            <li>Whisk sour cream and egg together in a small bowl until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir sour cream mixture into flour mixture using a fork until large dough clumps form. Use your hands to shape dough into a ball. (Dough may seem dry at first but will come together as you work it).</li>
            <li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7 to 8-inch circle, about 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 equal triangles; place on the prepared baking tray, about 1-inch apart.</li>
            <li>Bake scones in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
